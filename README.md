# HubSpot Developer Project Structure Examples

This repo contains a few examples of how we can structure a HubSpot Developer Project. These are not intended to work with
the current project's framework, but rather to show how we can structure a project in a way that is more flexible and
extensible. All while giving a familiar and uniform experience to developers.
